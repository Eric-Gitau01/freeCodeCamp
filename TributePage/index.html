            <h2>A Breif Biography</h2>
            <p>Martin Luther King Jr. was born on January 15, 1929, in Atlanta, Georgia. He was a Baptist minister and social activist who played a pivotal role in the American civil rights movement from the mid-1950s until his assassination in 1968.

            Inspired by his Christian faith and Mahatma Gandhi's nonviolent principles, MLK led many groundbreaking efforts for racial equality, including the Montgomery Bus Boycott and the March on Washington. His work earned him the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964 and cemented his place as one of history's greatest champions for justice.
